The intimidating-looking, and instantly recognizable Stegosaurus was the largest of plate-backed prehistoric herbivores. Scientists have suggested that the Stegosaurusâ€™ iconic plates were for defense against predators, but this is unlikely as the plates were quite thin. Others have said the Stegosaurusâ€™ spiked tail may have been used as a weapon. Terraâ€™s Stegosaurus toy accurately recreates the formidable size and terrifying presence of this iconic predator. In particular, the large, heavily built frame and rounded backs of the mighty Stegosaurus are faithfully depicted in the dinosaur replica.

The picture was â€œThe Big Trailâ€ (1930), where the 22-year-old Wayne was chosen to star as trail scout Break Coleman. America's favorite cowboy filmed his last movie \"The Shootist\" in 1976. He starred in 171 movies over a span of 50 years. This puzzle is called \"America's Cowboy\" and is a collage of the old western films \"Hondo\", \"Horse Soldiers\", \"Rio Bravo\", \"Rio Lobo\" and \"McLintock\".

The SugarBooger brand for babies, kids and the people who love them was inspired by the birth of Lisa's little boy. Her enthusiasm to create draws from a desire to design and improve upon safe, unique products for babies and kids that every family can use. Celebrating nearly 10 years of successful and safe children's products, our fans championed this brand into a collection of inspired, functional items that people love to buy for their own use - or for gifting to a new (or not so new.) parent or child.",
